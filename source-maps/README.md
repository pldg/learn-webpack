# Source Maps

A [source map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Debugger/How_to/Use_a_source_map) is a file that maps the transformed source code to the original one. By using a source map the developer can debug an app with more precision.

## Configuration

Webpack can be configured to serve multiple types of source maps using [devtool option](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/).

When running webpack in development mode [eval source map](https://webpack.js.org/configuration/devtool/#development) is generated by default inside the bundled file (inline source map). Running webpack in production mode do not emit source maps.

To enable source maps for stylesheets you must set [css-loader `sourceMap: true`](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/css-loader#sourcemap), style-loader will automatically inject source maps when previous loader emit them.

To extract source maps into a separate file set webpack `devtool: "source-map"` option, this produce high quality source maps but increase the build time.
